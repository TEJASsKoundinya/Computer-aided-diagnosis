# Computer aided diagnosis
*Dataset link: https://www.kaggle.com/nodoubttome/skin-cancer9-classesisic for skin diseases 
*Image processing for classification of skin disease and ct scan
*This code helps us to obtain a result all within a single neural network which reduces the complexity of the model
*The model can be designed to pre-process image to a different in texture and color-reverse which has a better option to increase its efficiency 
*The accuracy would definetly increase if both are treated as different models
